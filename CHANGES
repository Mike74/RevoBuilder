RevoBuilder V1.0.28
==================
- Add check for user not having a serial number to config.sh.

RevoBuilder V1.0.27
==================
- Amend BuildUSB.sh to write the stage 0 loader to more than the 1st partition. Useful for writing to an HDD partition

RevoBuilder V1.0.26
==================
- Amended config.h to match latest changes to STATIC_ECDT_TABLE_INJECTION.
- Amend BuildUSB.sh to set header of com.apple.Boot.plist to use appropriate string per OS version.

RevoBuilder V1.0.25
==================
- Amended config.sh to suit RevoBoot v1.0.22.
- Updated RevoBuilder/RevStart/Resources/Chameleon_Files to that from RC5 r1174. Note: boot0 is actually the new boot0md. So it doesn't need the USB partition set to active.

RevoBuilder V1.0.24
==================
- Attempt at making the BuildUSB script more complete by detecting the use of the PRE_LINKED_KERNEL_SUPPORT directive in settings.h. If found, include the system caches on the USB, otherwise copy /S*/L*/E* to the USB and then look for FakeSMC.kext to determine whether or not the USB can be booted. If not, then advise the user to manually add their /Extra kexts.

RevoBuilder V1.0.23
==================
- Added copying of /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kext.caches/Startup/ to  USB flash drive

==================
- Fixed a bug in the menu where a heading wasn't shown under certain conditions.

RevoBuilder V1.0.17
==================
- Some changes to the build a bootable flash drive option. Lots more to do on this yet - I consider this part as a work-in-progress.

RevoBuilder V1.0.16
==================
- Added menu option (after Clean) to build a bootable USB flash drive. It has been tested on default settings using SnowLeopard and Lion. It's not all singing all dancing and doesn't support things like a pre-linked kernel yet but here it works. It's only a first draft so there's plenty of room for code improvements etc.
